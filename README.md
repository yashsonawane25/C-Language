## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-language-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific topic folder and explore the `.c` files.
3. Compile and run the code using a C compiler, e.g., GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Goals

- Practice and master all essential and advanced concepts of C programming.
- Develop a strong foundation for system-level programming.
